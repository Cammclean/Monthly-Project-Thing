Here you are.
Mc:
Oh, its very orange.
Bartender:
This going on your tab again?
Mc:
Excuse me?
Bartender:
Your tab.
You don't pay up front very often.
Mc:
You recognize me?
Bartender:
I would hope so.
You come in here so much it would be hard not to at least recognize you.
Mc:
Ah, I see. Yeah, put it on my tab please.
Bartender:
Will do.

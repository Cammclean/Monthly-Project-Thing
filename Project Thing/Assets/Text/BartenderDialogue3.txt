Bartender:
Whats up?
Mc:
You wouldn't happen to have any spare change, would you?
Bartender:
Change? What for?
Mc:
I kind of forgot to reimburse my metro card.
So, I'm stuck.
Bartender:
Mm. Wow, quite the predicament.
This happen often?
Mc:
I'm sad to say that it has.
Bartender:
Well, sorry to hear that.
But, no I don't have anything on me.
And, I'm certainly not taking from the register.
Mc:
Damn.
Default:
Mc:
Are you sure? I really need to get home.
Bartender:
Sorry, ma'am. I'm not on the best terms with my manager so I really can't stick my neck out for you.
Mc:
*sigh*
Yeah, alright.
I'll try someone else.
Manipulation:
Mc:
Lets say I give you a really nice tip the next time I happen to pass by?
Could you maybe consider giving me enough to get on a subway?
I'd be in your debt.
Bartender:
Sounds tempting, but there's a problem.
My manager is currently running the register. And he isn't really on good terms with me in the first place.
But, if you could distract him somehow, I could probably sneak a few dollars from the register or tip jar.
Mc:
Okay, sounds like a plan.
Bartender:
Alright, just try to get his attention somehow.
Good luck.
